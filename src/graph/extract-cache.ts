/**
 * Per-file memo for Tier-1 extraction — `<outDir>/.cache/extract.json`.
 *
 * `extractFile` is pure and file-local (`rel`, `source`, `lang` → `{nodes,
 * rawEdges}`), which is the whole trick: an unchanged file's parse result can be
 * replayed from disk instead of re-running tree-sitter. That turns
 * {@link buildGraph} from "always re-parse the repo" (~4.6ms/file) into "re-parse
 * only what moved", which is what makes a rebuild cheap enough to run *before*
 * every query (see `graph/refresh.ts`).
 *
 * Everything downstream of extraction (edge resolution, enrichment, the graph
 * write, the ask sidecar, cards) still runs over the whole merged node set, so no
 * other invariant changes — an incremental build must produce a byte-identical
 * `wiring.json` to a cold one.
 *
 * Crucially the cached nodes keep `body_text`: `writeGraph` strips it before
 * serializing, so `wiring.json` can never be the reuse source — the ask sidecar
 * needs a body for every node, including the ones we didn't re-parse.
 *
 * Lives under `.cache/` (gitignored, regenerate-anytime) next to `ask-index.json`
 * and `summaries.json`. Two things invalidate the whole file: a bump of
 * {@link CACHE_VERSION} for a change of on-disk shape, and a change to the
 * extraction code itself, caught by content-hashing it — see
 * {@link extractorStamp}. Neither asks anyone to remember to bump anything.

 *
 * - **Not a timestamp.** This was `mtime:size` of `extract.js` alone, which is
 *   wrong in both directions. Too loose: the parse of `db.count()` depends on
 *   `bindings.ts` deciding that `db` is a `UserRepo` (that answer is stored *in*
 *   the cached entry, as an edge's `recvType`), and fixing a binding bug leaves
 *   `extract.js`'s emitted bytes untouched — so any build that skips rewriting
 *   unchanged output keeps the old stamp and silently replays pre-fix edges. Too
 *   tight: a rebuild that rewrites identical content moves the mtime and throws
 *   away the whole memo for nothing.
 * - **Not a hand-kept list of modules.** A list is correct exactly until someone
 *   moves parse logic into a module nobody added to it, and the failure is silent.
 *
 * Hashing the directory over-invalidates a little — editing any `graph/` module
 * costs one cold rebuild — which is no more often than a version bump already
 * costs, and always in the safe direction. The package version is folded in so a
 * tree-sitter grammar upgrade (which changes parse output without changing any of
 * graft's own files) invalidates too.
 *
 * Measured at ~0.5ms for 21 files / 556KB, paid once per process.
 *
 * **Null when no identity can be established at all**, and that is deliberately not
 * a string. It used to return `"unknown"` on failure — but `"unknown"` was then
 * *written into the sidecars as a real identity*, and every later run compared equal
 * to it, so any environment where stamping fails (a `pkg`/`bun-compile` single-file
 * build, an asar-style read, a directory that can't be listed) permanently lost the
 * ability to notice an extractor change. A sentinel that doubles as a valid value
 * silently disables the whole mechanism. Null forces callers to decide instead, and
 * {@link extractCachePath} decides not to have a memo.
