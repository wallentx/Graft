/**
 * The cheap "has the working tree moved?" probe that gates the pre-query rebuild.
 *
 * Every graft retrieval call runs this, so it has to be ~free on the common
 * unchanged path: a walk + one `stat` per source file, no reads, no parsing.
 * Measured at ~3ms for 280 files. Only files whose `(size, mtimeMs)` disagree
 * with the last build's record get read and hashed, which is what keeps a `touch`
 * or a `git checkout` of identical bytes from triggering a pointless rebuild.
 *
 * Note graft has no notion of git here (it never shells out to git, never reads
 * `.git`): drift is measured against the bytes in the working tree, so an
 * uncommitted, staged, or committed edit all look the same — which is the point.
 *
 * `<outDir>/.cache/fingerprint.json` is a projection of the extraction cache
 * (`extract-cache.ts`) minus the parse results, written by the same build. Keeping
 * it separate means the probe reads ~10KB instead of the multi-MB parse cache. The
 * two can only ever disagree by one sidecar going missing, and both directions
 * degrade safely: no fingerprint → "unknown, rebuild"; no parse cache → the
 * rebuild is just cold.
